Your role is to analyze a comparative "What-If" lifestyle simulation and provide constructive, personalized advice to help the user choose the best path forward.

=== USER PROFILE ===

- Current Age: {user_info['age']} years
- Target Retirement Age: {user_info['retirement_goal_age']} years
- Target Net Worth at Retirement: ${user_info['target_net_worth']:,.2f}

- Screen Time: {baseline['screen_hours']:.1f} hours/day
- Weekly Study Hours: {baseline['study_hours_week']:.1f} hours/week

=== COMPARATIVE WHAT-IF SCENARIOS (PROJECTED RESULTS) ===

SCENARIO A (MODIFICATIONS):
- Adjustments: Monthly savings change: {sa['details']['monthly_savings'] - baseline['monthly_savings']:+.2f}, Sleep change: {sa['details']['sleep'] - baseline['sleep_hours']:+.1f} hrs, Study change: {sa['details']['study_week'] - baseline['study_hours_week']:+.1f} hrs/week

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Write a comprehensive report comparing Scenario A and Scenario B.
Ensure you address:
1. **Tradeoff Analysis**: Detail the compromises. For example, is one scenario cutting sleep to gain study/savings? Explain the biological or psychological consequence (e.g. sleep deprivation reduces focus rating).
2. **Financial Critique**: Assess their retirement trajectory. Under which scenario are they more financially secure? Is the increased savings rate worth the lifestyle impact?
3. **Recommendation & Verdict**: Pick one scenario as the clear winner and explain why, or suggest a hybrid approach (Scenario C) that would optimize their goals.

Output the analysis in clean, professional markdown with beautiful emojis. Keep it concise, engaging, and directly addressed to the user.
